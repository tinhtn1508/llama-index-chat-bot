# llama-index-chat-bot

## Problem

Using OpenAI/Gemini/Claude API or open-source LLMs models, combined with the knowledge learned about RAG techniques, to build a Chatbot application that accurately answers questions related to all the articles on the llama-index blog: https://www.llamaindex.ai/blog.

## How to crawl data

```
python3 main.py --type crawler
```
## How to embed data

```
python3 main.py --type embedding --embedding_type transformer
```

## How ask question 

```
python3 main.py --type server --embedding_type transformer
```

## There are some question and answer from chat-bot

Question 1

```
Question: What are key features of llama-agents?

Thinking...

Llama-agents are a powerful and flexible framework designed to simplify the process of building, iterating, and deploying multi-agent AI systems. They have several key features that make them stand out:

1. Distributed Service Oriented Architecture: Each agent in LlamaIndex can operate as its own independently running microservice. These microservices are orchestrated by a fully customizable control plane powered by a language learning model (LLM). This control plane is responsible for routing and distributing tasks among the agents.

2. Communication via Standardized API Interfaces: Agents communicate with each other using a central control plane orchestrator. They pass messages between each other using a message queue, which is a type of asynchronous communication protocol.

3. Define Agentic and Explicit Orchestration Flows: Developers have the flexibility to directly define the sequence of interactions between agents. Alternatively, they can leave it up to an "agentic orchestrator" that decides which agents are relevant to the task at hand.

4. Ease of Deployment: Llama-agents allow you to launch, scale, and monitor each agent and your control plane independently.

5. Scalability and Resource Management: Llama-agents come with built-in observability tools that help monitor the quality and performance of the system and each individual agent service.

In summary, llama-agents provide a robust framework for building complex multi-agent AI systems, offering the tools needed for both prototyping new ideas and scaling to production. Whether you're working on complex question-answering systems, collaborative AI assistants, or distributed AI workflows, llama-agents can help bring your AI vision to life.

Question 2

```
Question: What are the two critical areas of RAG system performance that are assessed in the "Evaluating RAG with LlamaIndex" section of the OpenAI Cookbook?

Thinking...

The two critical areas of RAG system performance assessed in the "Evaluating RAG with LlamaIndex" section of the OpenAI Cookbook are the Retrieval System and Response Generation.

The Retrieval System is the part of the RAG system that is responsible for finding and fetching relevant information from a large dataset in response to a user's query. Its performance is crucial because it directly impacts the quality of information available for the next step, Response Generation.

Response Generation, on the other hand, is the process where the RAG system uses the retrieved information to construct a meaningful and accurate response to the user's query. Its performance determines the overall usefulness and reliability of the RAG system.

In both areas, the OpenAI Cookbook employs a unique synthetic dataset generation method called generate_question_context_pairs to conduct thorough evaluations, aiming to help developers effectively evaluate and enhance their RAG systems developed using LlamaIndex.

Question 3

```
Question: What are the two main metrics used to evaluate the performance of the different rerankers in the RAG system?

Thinking...

The two main metrics used to evaluate the performance of different rerankers in the RAG system are Hit Rate and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). Hit Rate measures whether the retrieved documents are relevant to the user query, but it doesn't consider the position or ranking of these documents. On the other hand, Mean Reciprocal Rank takes into account the position of the first relevant document in the ranked list of documents. These metrics are crucial in determining the effectiveness of a reranker in improving the performance of a RAG system.
