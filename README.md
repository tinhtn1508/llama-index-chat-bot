# llama-index-chat-bot

## Problem

Using OpenAI/Gemini/Claude API or open-source LLMs models, combined with the knowledge learned about RAG techniques, to build a Chatbot application that accurately answers questions related to all the articles on the llama-index blog: https://www.llamaindex.ai/blog.

## How to crawl data

```
python3 main.py --type crawler
```
## How to embed data

```
python3 main.py --type embedding --embedding_type transformer
```

## How ask question 

```
python3 main.py --type server --embedding_type transformer
```

## There are some question and answer from chat-bot

Question 1

```
Question: What are key features of llama-agents?

Thinking...

There are a few key features of llama-agents:
1. **Distributed Service-Oriented Architecture:** 
This feature allows each agent in LlamaIndex to run independently as its own microservice, orchestrated by a customizable LLM-powered control plane that routes and distributes tasks.


2. **Communication via Standardized API Interfaces:** 
Agents interface with each other using a central control plane orchestrator and pass messages between each other using a message queue.


3. **Define Agentic and Explicit Orchestration Flows:** 
Developers have the flexibility to define the sequence of interactions between agents directly or leave it up to an “agentic orchestrator” that decides which agents are relevant to the task. 


4. **Ease of Deployment:** 
Each agent and its control plane can be launched, scaled and monitored independently for ease of deployment.


5. **Scalability and Resource Management:** 
Built-in observability tools can be used to monitor the quality and performance of each individual agent service and the system as a whole.

Question 2

```
Question: What are the two critical areas of RAG system performance that are assessed in the "Evaluating RAG with LlamaIndex" section of the OpenAI Cookbook?

Thinking...

Sure, the two critical RAG system performance areas assessed in the "Evaluating RAG with LlamaIndex" section of the OpenAI Cookbook are:
    
    1. **Retrieval System:** This system assesses how well the RAG system can retrieve relevant passages from a given context for response generation.
    
    2. **Response Generation:** This system assesses the quality of the responses generated by the RAG system based on their relevance, coherence, and grammatical correctness.

Question 3

```
Question: What are the two main metrics used to evaluate the performance of the different rerankers in the RAG system?

Thinking...

To judge how well the various rerankers in the RAG system perform, two primary metrics are utilized: Hit Rate and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). Hit Rate measures the percentage of queries for which the reranker successfully retrieves at least one relevant document, while MRR calculates the average position of the first relevant document retrieved across all queries. These metrics collectively provide a comprehensive assessment of the reranker's ability to locate and prioritize relevant information.
